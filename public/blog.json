        "question": "What is useState and how does it work in React?",
        "answer": "useState is a React Hook that allows functional components to have their own state. It returns a state variable and a function to update that state. When the state changes using the update function, React re-renders the component to reflect the new state. Itâ€™s commonly used for managing dynamic data like form inputs, counters, or toggles.",

        "question": "What is the purpose of useEffect in React?",
        "answer": "useEffect is a React Hook used to handle side effects in functional components, like fetching data, updating the DOM, or setting up timers. It runs after the component renders and can re-run based on specific dependencies. You can also clean up effects (like removing event listeners) using the return function inside useEffect.",

        "question": "What is a custom hook in React and when should you use one?",
        "answer": "A custom hook in React is a reusable function that uses one or more built-in React hooks (like useState, useEffect, etc.) to encapsulate logic you want to reuse across components.You should use a custom hook when multiple components share similar logic (e.g. form handling, fetching data, or toggling states), to keep your code clean, DRY, and easier to maintain.",

        "question": "Difference between controlled and uncontrolled components? Which one is better?",
        "answer": "In React, controlled components manage form data through state (useState), giving full control over input values and changes. Uncontrolled components rely on the DOM, using ref to access values. Controlled components are preferred for dynamic or complex forms, while uncontrolled ones are suitable for simple use cases.",

        "answer": "useFormStatus() is used to track and respond to the state of form submissions in React, especially in modern server-driven apps, improving user interaction during async form handling. useFormStatus() is a React Hook from the react-dom package introduced with React 18.2+, mainly used with <form> and <form action> in server components or React Server Actions.",
